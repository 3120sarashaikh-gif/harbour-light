### A Guiding Light for Immigrants in a New Land

## Overview
**Harbour Light** is a multilingual digital hub designed to address one of the most critical challenges faced by immigrants — accessing verified and trustworthy information when navigating a new country.  

The platform consolidates essential, location-specific resources related to healthcare, housing, legal aid, sustenance, and employment. Its purpose is to serve as a single, reliable source for newcomers seeking clarity and direction during the initial stages of resettlement.

## Objectives
1. **Consolidated Access to Critical Services**  
   Harbour Light provides a curated directory of essential resources, including healthcare providers, legal aid, housing services, food banks, and local job listings.  
   It features **location-based filtering** to ensure all results are relevant, current, and actionable.

2. **Crisis Support and Capacity Building**  
   The platform integrates direct access to verified emergency helplines for medical, legal, and personal crises.  
   In addition, it lists free educational and vocational programs that promote long-term self-sufficiency and integration.

3. **Accessible and Multilingual Design**  
   Harbour Light goes beyond translation by offering a fully multilingual interface complemented by **community-sourced narratives** and testimonials.  
   These provide cultural insights and foster a sense of shared experience and resilience among newcomers.
